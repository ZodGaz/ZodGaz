# Hi, I'm Alessio.

I’m a developer in the middle of an evolution.

My roots are deep in the backend world. I spent years building Java frameworks and dealing with the nitty-gritty of IoT and low-level C/C++ protocols. While I might need a manual to write a C++ pointer today, that experience taught me how computers actually think—discipline that still grounds my work.

Lately, I’ve been moving towards the "front". I realized that to truly build products, I needed to own the full stack. I’m currently building web and desktop apps using React, Electron, and BaaS solutions.
*Full disclosure:* I’m not a CSS wizard yet. Still learning.

### Open Source lover
For me, Open Source isn't just about free software; it's about collective intelligence. I spend a lot of time reading code I didn't write—even in languages I don't use—because I respect the craft.
I’ve contributed to projects like **[JabRef](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref)**, and while I’m not a monthly maintainer, every PR I merge reminds me that software should be a funded, common good.

## What I'm building
I consider myself a mix between an engineer and a craftsman.

* **[Neutone](https://apps.apple.com/it/app/neutone/id6445848829):** A project I loved from the **Apple Developer Academy**. It started as a research challenge: detecting skin undertones accurately in real-time. We didn't just wrap an API; we engineered a custom CNN pipeline, augmented over **7,000 images** with Python, and optimized it to run entirely on-device via CoreML. It’s live on the App Store as a testament to those months of R&D.

* **Current Experiments:** Exploring how far I can push serverless architectures to replace traditional heavy backends.

I’m always down to chat about code, Linux, or **emulators** (I have a massive soft spot for how retro-consoles work).
